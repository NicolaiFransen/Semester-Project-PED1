\chapter*{Preface}

This paper describes the "P0" report of the group project "DC-DC converter for PV module integration." It has been developed from the $10^{th}$ of September to the $9^{th}$ of October 2018, at Aalborg University, Institute of Energy, by the group INTRO-760.

The "P0" is an initial report which discusses research about maximizing the electrical power generated by PV modules.
Furthermore, a theoretical comparison between different converter's topologies has been carried out in order to decide which MIC is going to be used in this project. After the "P0" report there will be a "P1" report which will include the entire development of the project.

The literature references are shown in square brackets, with a number referring to a specific document which can be found in the bibliography. Pictures and tables will be denoted in the X,Y format, with X representing the chapter and Y the figure or table number. 

The process and development of "P0" has been based on the Problem Based Learning $(PBL)$ method. This method is explained in the appendix \ref{PBL}. This method will also be applied for the "P1" report.
