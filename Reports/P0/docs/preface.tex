\chapter*{Preface}

This paper describes the "P0" report of the group project "DC-DC converter for PV module integration." It has been developed from the $10^{th}$ of September to the $9^{th}$ of October 2018, at Aalborg University, Institute of Energy, by the group INTRO-760.

The "P0" is an initial report which discusses research about maximizing the power from PV modules.
Furthermore a theoretical comparison between different converter topologies has been done. After "P0" there will be a "P1" report which will include the entire project.

The literature references are shown in square brackets, with a number referring to a specific document which can be found in the bibliography. Pictures and tables will be denoted in the X,Y format, with X representing the chapter and Y the figure or table number. 

The process and development of "P0" has been based on the Problem Based Learning $(PBL)$ method. This method is explained in the appendix. This method will also be used for "P1".
