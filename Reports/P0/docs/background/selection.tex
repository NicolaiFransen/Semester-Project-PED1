\section{Selection of topology}
The selection of converter topology will be made from the research discovered earlier in this chapter. The converter should be able to allow both a higher and a lower output than the input. This requirement will stress the buck and boost converters, which only converts either up or down. This means that before the requirement is meet, both a buck and boost converter must be a part the implementation. This is not desirable, because it will introduce unnecessary work.  

The next requirement states that the converter should have as high an efficiency as possible. The flyback converter will have a lower efficiency than the buck-boost, because of the transformer. This will introduce a loss in the extra inductor winding, and a larger loss in the FET because of the turns ratio in the transformer. Using a 4-switch buck-boost converter, in stead of a 2-switch, it is possible to further optimizing the power loss because of the use of FET's instead of diodes. 

The 4-switch buck-boost converter does also has the advantage of being bidirectional. This means that it's possible to either extract a current from the PV-module to the inverter at the output, or to inject a current from the inverter to the PV-module. Because that the PV-modules acts like photodiodes, they will radiate an infrared light if current are injected. If the PV-modules are damaged in some way, i.e. having cracks, the radiation will be affected. This means that it is possible to discover faulty modules before efficiency drops. This will increase the overall efficiency of the system, and ease the maintenance sequence significantly. 

The Bidirectional Non-Inverting Buck-Boost converter is chosen because of these arguments. How ever the bidirectional functionality will not be addressed in this project, but could be a part of further development of the converter.
