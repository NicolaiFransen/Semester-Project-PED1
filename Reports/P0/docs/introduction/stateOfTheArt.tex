To this date, sustainable energy sources have become an area in focus worldwide in an attempt to reduce the environmental impact due to emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses. The development of competitive systems to exploit renewable energy sources is the best alternative to reduce the use of fossil fuels for the production of electricity. Over the last years there have been a considerable increase in electricity production from renewable energy sources being the fastest growing sector wind and solar energy. In 2017, solar photovoltaic was the renewable energy source which experienced the highest increased in newly installed capacity amounting a total installed capacity of approximately 402 GW.[ref] %[http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/17-8652_GSR2018_FullReport_web_-1.pdf] 

Photovoltaic (PV) is referred to the production of electricity in the form of direct current (DC) directly from sunlight shining on solar cells. Solar cells are semiconductor devices which typically can produce around 0.5 V DC so they are series connected to form a PV module/panel which can also be connected to other PV panels resulting in a PV array. This way, according to the system´s requirements, the PV panels can be interconnected in series or parallel in order to get at the output a higher voltage or current, respectively. Connecting PV panels either in series or parallel will result in an increase of the system´s overall electricity production.  %[http://www.sabz-energy.com/solar%20electricity%20handbook%202017.pdf] 

Nevertheless, it is essential to keep into consideration the mismatches that may appear between the power generated by the different PV panels, which will result in losses in the PV system and thus in a lower efficiency. Mismatches occur when the PV modules operate in a different operating point than its maximum power point (MPP) due to partial shading, manufacturing tolerances, defects in the PV modules due to weather conditions and aging, among others. Even a small mismatch in one of the PV modules can result in a very high reduction of the power production from the entire PV array. Mismatch losses in a PV system can be reduced by forcing every PV module to work at its MPP by using a technique known as Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). This can be reached by using electronic devices called Module Integrated Converters (MICs) which basically consist on DC-AC micro inverters or DC-DC converters that incorporate a MPPT unit to ensure that the output power of the MIC is the one corresponding to the MPP of the PV module.%[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/43248773_Study_on_MPP_mismatch_losses_in_photovoltaic_applications] 

This project focuses on the design and test of a MIC based on a non-inverting buck-boost DC/DC converter for integration with a PV module in order to operate at its MPP and thus harvest maximum energy from the sunlight. 

\section{PV generation}

The phenomenon on which the transformation of solar energy to electrical energy is based is known as the \textit{Photovoltaic effect}. This phenomenon was first discovered by a French physicist named Edmond Becquerel in 1839 and is based on the emission, from the sunlight or light, of massless photons which collate on two superimposed layers of semiconductor material causing some of the electrons to flow and, hence, allowing the generation of voltage and electric current. Solar PV cells are made of a negative charged layer (n-layer) and a positive charged layer (p-layer) of a semiconductor material, usually crystalline silicon, joined establishing a pn-junction. If photons emitted by the light, when they collide with the n-layer,  have enough energy to excite the electrons an electric field will be formed in the p-n junction due to the attraction of electrons and holes. This electric field will work as a diode permitting the separation of the positive and negative charge carriers.  This way electric current will flow across the pn-junction allowing the generation of electric energy. %[https://www.ab.gov.tr/files/ardb/evt/1_avrupa_birligi/1_9_politikalar/1_9_6_enerji_politikasi/2009_report-solar-energy.pdf]
 The greater the intensity of the light (irradiance) that is absorbed by the PV panel the higher the amount of electric power generated. On the other hand, the efficiency of the panel will decrease with the temperature. Usually, PV panels are tested under standard test conditions (STC) which is at 25$\dec$C and 1000 $W/ m^2$. %[ http://www.sabz-energy.com/solar%20electricity%20handbook%202017.pdf]
Some of the most important characteristics associated with a PV panel’s datasheet are the following: maximum power point (Pmax), open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Isc), MPP voltage (Vmpp), MPP current (Impp) and efficiency ($\eta$).  %[ http://www.sabz-energy.com/solar%20electricity%20handbook%202017.pdf]
These features are important to define the I-V curves of the PV panel in order to develop the MPPT controller.
