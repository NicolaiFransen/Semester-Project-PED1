\noindent This report has been written with \LaTeX{} using TeXstudio. During the project PLECS, MATLAB and LTspice have been used for simulations, while the RT-box from Plexim has been used for implementation of the control system. The creation of flow charts have been done using www.draw.io. Hardware schematic and PCB layout have been created using Altium Designer.

%Here you can write something about which tools and software you have used for typesetting the document, running simulations and creating figures. If you do not know what to write, either leave this page blank or have a look at the colophon in some of your books.
