\subsection{Output capacitor} \label{output_cap_discussion}	
The output capacitor was sized 10 times to big, because of a calculation error. This meant that the voltage ripple at the output was in the range of 10 times lower than the requirements stated. To achieve an output ripple voltage at $0.5\%$ with a margin at $20\%$, a $100\mu F$ capacitor should be used. A suggestion could be this $100 \mu F$ electrolytic capacitor from Panasonic \cite{new_out_cap_datasheet}.
