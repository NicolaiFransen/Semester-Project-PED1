\subsection{Output capacitor} \label{output_cap_discussion}	
The output capacitor was oversized by a factor of 10 due wrong initial sizing. This means that the voltage ripple at the output is in around 10 times lower than the requirements state. To achieve an output ripple voltage of $0.5\%$ with a margin at $20\%$, a $156\mu F$ capacitor should be used.
