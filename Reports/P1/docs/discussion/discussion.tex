\section{Validation of experimental results}
\subsection{Open loop simulation}
\todo{This was written in chapter 6.}
The main losses are the dissipation from the component in heat. Also the load is a power resistor and it changes the resistance if it is in operation. So we have not a constant load at the output as in the simulation. Another reason is the dead-time of the MOSFET and therefore the duty cycle is not exactly the same value as in the simulation. 

The table \ref{tab:ripple} compares the values of the ripples from the experiments with the values from the requirements in section \ref{sec:componentsizing} and the simulation results in appendix \ref{app:OL_ripple}. So in all three cases the measured ripples from the experiment are higher/lower than the values from the requirement. Here the reason.

\subsection{MPPT drifting and improvement and limitations of final control algorithm}
The development of an embedded control system requires the proper working of an algorithm. During the development process, the engineer might find that the code doesn't behave as intended. A common way of supporting the debugging process consists on the use of breakpoints, where the code is stopped and the variables' value might be read. However, as this feature is not supported by the used platform, and in the case of controlling physical systems its use would be limited to simulation, alternative techniques had to be used. The adopted approach consisted on outputting the FSMs state and relevant values for the current state at every code execution loop. The 'Timestamp' field is specially important during simulation in order to track specific events at determined times. See figure \ref{console_output}.

In initial implementations of the control algorithm, the voltage evaluation was performed in the state next to the duty cycle change. After this change, the system experiences a transient stage where the input voltage and inductor current evolve into the new steady state value. If these variables are read during the transient, the control might infer that the PV panel is in a location of the P-V curve different than where it actually is. The MPPT becomes noisier under this scenario. In order to address this issue, an additional waiting state was added to the FSM governing the system. Another solution to the issue would be to decrease the MPPT algorithm periodicity. However this solution would lead to a decrease in system's responsiveness. However this drawback might be bearable by implementing a voltage controller aside from the MPPT.

\subsection{software filtering}
Although the voltage and current measurement is filtered, the signal read by the control system was noisy. This noise affected the MPPT algorithm disturbing its ability to reach the MPP. Such noise might have different sources within a lab with such a big amount of hardware equipment. There are many techniques in order to address noise issues, the used technique consists on the use of digital filtering (LPF). This digital filter is a  simple code that performs the filtering at a given frequency. Being a first order filter, it was simple and fast to implement and test.
