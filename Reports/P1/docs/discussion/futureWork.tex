\section{Future work}
4- Recommendations for future work. Make general statements. Items: a)what study is needed, b)Methods to be used, c)what is needed for that study.

\subsection{Different MPPT technique}

\subsection{V/I controller}

\subsection{Switching frequency limitations}

\subsection{Hardware improvements}
bootstrap, change driver to the A version due to voltage levels and then change the optocouupler to a quad version,...

\subsection{Component price, system size, optimization needed}
Component prize and system size will be introduced during the other sections...

\subsection{Efficiency}
