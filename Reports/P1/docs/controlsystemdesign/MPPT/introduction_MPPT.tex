This chapter contains the control of the Buck-Boost-converter, so that the PV-model works at the maximum operating point during operation. To achieve this, a MPPT algorithm is implemented. The output signal from the MPPT algorithm can be the duty cycle for the MSOFET or a reference voltage which will be processed by the current and voltage regulators to get the duty cycle. A PWM generates the control of the MOSFET by the duty cycle. At the beginning of the chapter different methods for MPPT are introduced. These are explained in more detail using flow diagrams. Then the advantages and disadvantages of the methods are compared and one of the methods is implemented in the project. Then the description of the implemented algorithm with a flow chart follows. To validate the algorithm, a simulation of a Buck-Boost converter with the self-created MPPT algorithm is created with the program Plecs.
