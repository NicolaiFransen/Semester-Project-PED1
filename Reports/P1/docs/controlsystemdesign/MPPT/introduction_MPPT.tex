This chapter contains the control of the Buck-Boost converter, so that the PV-model works at the maximum power point during operation. To achieve this, a MPPT algorithm is implemented. The output signal from the MPPT controller can be the duty cycle or a reference voltage. The duty cycle can connect directly to the PWM. The reference voltage is compared to voltage from the pv panel and the voltage and current controls are changed the voltage in the necessary duty cycle signal. The PWM indicates how long the MOSFET is switched on for a period of time, allowing the output voltage of the converter to be regulated.\newline
At the beginning of the chapter different methods for MPPT are introduced. The subchapter "Selection of MPPT algorithm" describes the pro and contra of the methods and compare each other. The result of this discussion should give us the best method for the converter. Then the description of the implemented algorithm follows with a flow chart. To validate the algorithm, a simulation of a Buck-Boost converter with the MPPT algorithm is created with the program Plecs.
