\section{Sensors} \label{sensors}
To implement the MPPT it's necessary to measure the output voltage and current of the PV-module. These measurements will be obtained by implementing a voltage and current sensor. A second voltage sensor will be implemented to measure the output voltage of the DC/DC coverter, for possible future use. 

To protect the RT-Box, it has been chosen to fully isolate it from the power stage of the converter. To do so, the sensors will have to include isolation between input and output.
