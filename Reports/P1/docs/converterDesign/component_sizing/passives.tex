The power circuit includes three main passive components which are the inductor, the input capacitor ($C_{in}$) and the output capacitor ($C_{out}$). In order to calculate the values for minimal inductance and capacitance that components need to have, the worst case scenario was considered. According to these values, the coil will influence the maximum current ripple that there will flow through it while the capacitors will set the voltage ripple at the input and at the output of the MIC. 

Therefore, in order to calculate these values the ripples have been set. For the current through the coil, a 10\% maximum ripple has been chosen. The output capacitor will  have a maximum of 0.5\% voltage ripple. However, the input capacitor makes the PV-module output voltage flat, therefore the ripple found at $C_{in}$ directly influences the maximum power extracted from the PV since it produces a deviation from the MPP. Giving this, a low input voltage ripple of 0.1\% has been selected.

The ripple, however, also depends on the working frequency of the switches. In the case of this converter, such frequency has been set to 50kHz. 

On the other hand, since the ripples are a percentage of the absolute current or voltage, the worst case scenario for calculating the ripples will be when the current or voltages are lowest. A lower limit is then implemented at which the values will be calculated, this is the solar panel working at $400 W/m^3$ and at a temperature of $25 ÂºC$.

Under this conditions, the MPP voltage obtained is $V_{mpp} = 36.25V$ and the MPP current is $I_{mpp} = 3.23A$.

The minimum current flow through the coil is achieved when the boost mode is working. For this, the inductance is calculated for the maximum output voltage, which is when 4 MICs are connected in series. According to the equations stated in the appendix \ref{ch:Appbuckboost}, the inductance has been sized to $I_{L} = 1.3mH$.

On the other hand, the voltage used for $C_{in}$ will be found when buck mode is working with 15 MICs connected in series. This is a total output voltage of $24 V$. 
With the equations stated in appendix \ref{ch:Appbuckboost}, $C_{in} = 603 \mu F$.

Finally, $C_{out}$ was calculated for the worst case scenario, which in this case is working in boost mode with a duty cycle of $D = 0.5$ (Appendix \ref{ch:Appbuckboost}). Also, the worst case scenario for $C_{out}$ is when the power generated by the PV-module is maximum, 300W.
In this case, the obtained value for the ouput capacitance is $C_{out} = 65 \mu F$, (appendix \ref{ch:Appbuckboost}).
