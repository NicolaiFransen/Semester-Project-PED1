\section{Power Supplies}\label{power_supplies}
In the first iteration of the converter, the drivers and the sensors will be supplied by an external $12V$ voltage source. This source will be used directly to supply the two lower leg MOSFET drivers. To support the higher leg drivers two isolating $12V$ supplies will be used, with the external $12V$ as input. These will be two TRACO supply \textit{TMA1212S}. The chosen voltage sensors need a $5V$ power supply at both input and output of the sensor. These should isolated from each other. The input side will be supplied by a $5V$ voltage regulator, \textit{LD1117}, and the output side will be supplied by the RT-box. The current sensor will also be supplied with $5V$ by the RT-box.
