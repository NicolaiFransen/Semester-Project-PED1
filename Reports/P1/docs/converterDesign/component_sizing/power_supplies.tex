\subsection{Power Supplies}\label{power_supplies}
In the first iteration of the converter, the drivers and the sensors will be supplied by an external $12V$ voltage source. This source will be used directly to supply the two lower leg MOSFET drivers. To support the higher leg drivers, two isolating $12V$ supplies will be used, with the external $12V$ as input. These will be two TRACO supplies \textit{TMA1212S} \cite{traco_tma1212}. The chosen voltage sensors need a $5V$ power supply at both input and output of the sensor. These should be isolated from each other. The input side will be supplied by a $5V$ voltage regulator, \textit{LD1117} \cite{LD1117}, and the output side will be supplied by an external $5V$ source. The current sensor will also be supplied with $5V$ by the external voltage source. A LED will be added to every voltage source, to indicate if they are working.
