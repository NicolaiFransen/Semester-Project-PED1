\begin{enumerate}
	\item Go over assignment - objectives.  
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Design a DC-DC converter for integration with a PV panel.
		\item Analyze different implementations of MPPT techniques and implement the selected control system. 
		\item Hardware implementation of the MIC components including the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layout.
		\item Test of the system using a PV simulator and validation of the results. 
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Revisit introduction to make sure that the conclusion is consistent.
	\item Use RERUN:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Restate lab experiment.
		\item Explain purpose of the project.
		\item Explain the results.
		\item Account for uncertainties and errors. Beyond control circumstancesÂ¿?.
		\item Discuss new questions.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item other sections to add to rerun: what have we learned?
\end{enumerate}
