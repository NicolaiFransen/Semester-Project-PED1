%%% Introduction to the chapter: Hardware implementation %%%

This chapter contains the hardware implementation of the non-inverting buck-boost converter. This mainly consists of the selection of commercial components, including switches, drivers, sensors, passive components etc. Additional circuits will also be designed to support the selected components. For the switch selection, power loss and temperature dissipation will be considered. This chapter also includes creation of the schematics and the PCB layout for the entire hardware implementation.
