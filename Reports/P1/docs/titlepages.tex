}{% the abstract
  PV modules must work at their Maximum Power Point (MPP) to achieve the highest efficiency. Several environmental condition like partial shading and temperature change can reduce the output power of the PV modules. The goal of this project is to design a Module Integrated Converter (MIC) for a PV module. It should be able to drive the PV at it's MPP when the weather conditions change. A MIC consist of a DC-DC converter and a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm. It's decided to implement a non-inverting buck-boost converter with a Perturb and Observe (P\&O) MPPT algorithm. The objective of the project is to be able to drive a PV module at it's MPP constantly regardless of the environmental conditions.
