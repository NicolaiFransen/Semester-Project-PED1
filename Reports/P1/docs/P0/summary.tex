\chapter*{Summary}

%- What there already exists

A DC-DC converter is designed to maximize the power generation of PV modules under mismatch conditions. These mismatches might appear due to partial shading, uneven dirt distribution, manufacturing tolerances and ageing among others. The DC-DC converter is connected to each PV panel becoming a module integrated converter (MIC).

%- What we have done

An overview of the different DC-DC topologies has been performed, the bidirectional buck-boost converter has been selected because it best fulfills the requirements of high efficiency, bidirectional energy flow and input voltage increase and decrease capability. An analysis of the input and output conditions has been done in order to define the system requirements for the project. For this, commercial grid inverters, MICs and PV modules' figures of merit have been evaluated.

%- What we'll do

The future work of this project will cover the design and implementation of a MIC valid for generic PV modules. Design, simulation, implementation and testing will be performed and conclusions on the project will be drawn.
