\section{Problem statement}

The problem statement for this project can be formulated as the following question: 
\newline

\textbf{\textit{\large{How can a module integrated converter be designed to maximize the PV power generation under real conditions?}}}
\newline
\newline
The problem statement will be answered by fulfilling the following objectives: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Design a DC-DC converter for integration with a PV panel.
	\item Analyze different implementations of MPPT techniques and implement the selected control system. 
	\item Hardware implementation of the MIC components including PCB layout.
	\item Test of the system using a PV simulator and validation of the results. 
\end{itemize}
