\section{Problem statement}

The problem statement for this project can be formulated as the following question: \newline
\textbf{How can a module integrated converter be designed to maximize the PV power generation under real conditions?}
\newline
\newline
The problem statement will be answered by fulfilling the following objectives: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Design an efficient DC-DC converter for integration with a PV panel.
	\item Analyze different implementations of MPPT techniques and implement the selected control system. 
	\item Hardware implementation of the MIC components including PCB layout.
	\item Test of the system using a PV simulator and validation of the results. 
\end{itemize}
\todo{We have to reorganize the P0 part. The structure isn't fit with the parts what we wrote now. My idea for the structure is: 1. Introduction, 2 Problem Analysis 3. State of the Art, 3.1 Photovoltaic generation,3.2 MIC Implementation (maybe we can add  the research of MPPT algorithm here), Background of converter topologies, from chapter 4 on the order should be kept. TL}
\todo{we can add for the following objectives: Component sizing for the converter and validation from the components}
