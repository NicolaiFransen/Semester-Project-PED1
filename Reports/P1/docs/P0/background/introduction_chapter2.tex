\todo{We are not sure if State of the Art is the right title of chapter 2. }

There are a variety of different techniques for finding the maximum power point. Therefore only three different methods are used in this thesis, otherwise it would go beyond the scope of this work. These three methods are the perturb and observe, constant voltage and incremental conductance. Perturb and observe and incremental conductance are the most used algorithms in commercial pv-panels. On the other hand, constant voltage has been selected as an idea for other less used methods.
