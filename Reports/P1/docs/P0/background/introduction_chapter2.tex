The main topic for this project consist of designing a MIC. This is a DC-DC converter and a MPPT to be integrated in a PV module. Therefore, this chapter first analyzes different topologies for DC-DC converters commonly used in MICs. It also gives some background information of the most common MPPT techniques.
